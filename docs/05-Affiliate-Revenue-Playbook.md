## 10. REVENUE MILESTONES & TARGETS

### 10.1 Milestone Celebration Points

| Milestone | Target Date | Reward |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| First ₹1,000 earned | Month 3-4 | Screenshot it. Frame it. |
| First ₹10,000 month | Month 5-6 | Upgrade one tool (paid plan) |
| First ₹50,000 month | Month 8-9 | Consider hiring a freelance writer |
| First ₹1,00,000 month | Month 10-12 | Invest in paid SEO tool |
| First ₹2,50,000 month | Month 14-16 | Consider full-time focus |
| First ₹5,00,000 month | Month 16-18 | You have built a real business |

### 10.2 Revenue Reinvestment Strategy

| Revenue Level | Reinvest In |
|--------------|-------------|
| ₹0-₹25,000/month | Content tools (ChatGPT, Canva) |
| ₹25,000-₹1,00,000/month | Freelance writer + SEO tool |
| ₹1,00,000-₹3,00,000/month | Video editor + email tool upgrade + paid ads |
| ₹3,00,000+/month | Full team (writer, VA, designer) + premium tools |

### 10.3 The Compound Revenue Effect

```
Month 1-3:    ₹0-₹5,000/month     → "Is this worth it?" (YES)
Month 4-6:    ₹10,000-₹40,000     → "It's starting to work"
Month 7-9:    ₹50,000-₹1,00,000   → "This is real money"
Month 10-12:  ₹1,50,000-₹2,50,000 → "This is a business"
Month 13-15:  ₹2,50,000-₹4,00,000 → "This is changing my life"
Month 16-18:  ₹4,00,000-₹6,00,000 → "I built something valuable"
```

**The key insight:** Revenue does not grow linearly. It compounds. Month 1-6 is the hardest. Month 6-18 is where everything accelerates. Most people quit at month 3-4. Don't be most people.
