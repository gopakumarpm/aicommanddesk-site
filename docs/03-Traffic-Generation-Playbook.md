| Month 18 | 1,00,000-1,50,000 | Full compound effect |

---

## 2. ORGANIC SEARCH (SEO) — PRIMARY CHANNEL

### 2.1 Why SEO Is Your #1 Channel

- **Free traffic** that compounds over time
- **High intent** visitors (they searched for your topic)
- **Passive income** generator (articles rank while you sleep)
- **Authority builder** (Google rankings = credibility)

### 2.2 SEO Traffic Growth Model

```
Month 1-2: Almost zero organic traffic (indexing phase)
Month 3: First rankings appear (long-tail keywords)
Month 4-5: 2,000-5,000 organic visits
Month 6-8: 10,000-25,000 (compounding effect)
Month 9-12: 30,000-65,000 (authority building)
Month 12+: 65,000+ (exponential growth phase)
```

### 2.3 Quick SEO Wins (First 30 Days)

1. **Submit sitemap** to Google Search Console immediately
2. **Request indexing** for every new page published
3. **Target ultra-low competition keywords** (KD < 15) first
4. **Write longer content** than top-ranking competitors (2,000+ words)
5. **Add FAQ sections** to articles (triggers featured snippets)
6. **Use tables** in every article (Google loves structured data)
7. **Internal link** every new article to 3-5 existing articles

### 2.4 Featured Snippet Strategy

Target these "Position Zero" opportunities:

| Snippet Type | How to Win It | Example |
|-------------|---------------|---------|
| **Paragraph** | Answer the question in 40-60 words directly under an H2 | "What is AI automation?" → Write a concise definition |
| **List** | Use numbered or bulleted lists | "Best AI tools for managers" → Numbered list |
| **Table** | Add comparison tables | "AI tools pricing comparison" → HTML table |
| **How-to** | Use step-by-step format | "How to use ChatGPT at work" → Step 1, Step 2... |

## 3. LINKEDIN STRATEGY — SECONDARY CHANNEL

### 3.1 Why LinkedIn Is Critical for This Niche

- Your target audience (managers, consultants, professionals) lives on LinkedIn
- AI content performs exceptionally well on LinkedIn in 2026

- Drives highly qualified traffic (professionals with buying power)

### 3.2 LinkedIn Content Strategy

**Posting frequency:** 5 times per week (Monday to Friday)
**Best posting times:** 8:00-9:00 AM IST or 12:00-1:00 PM IST

**Content mix:**

| Day | Content Type | Format | Example |
|-----|-------------|--------|---------|
| Monday | AI Tip of the Week | Short text post (150-200 words) | "One AI tool that saved me 3 hours this week..." |
| Tuesday | Blog post promotion | Text + link (300 words of value first) | Share key insight from Tuesday's blog post |
| Wednesday | Personal story/opinion | Story post (300-500 words) | "I was skeptical about AI until..." |
| Thursday | Blog post promotion | Text + link | Share key insight from Thursday's blog post |

### 3.4 LinkedIn Engagement Strategy (Critical)

**Daily engagement routine (20-30 min):**

4. Engage in 2-3 LinkedIn groups related to AI, management, or productivity

**Comment quality matters more than quantity. Write 2-3 sentence comments that add value, not "Great post!"**
