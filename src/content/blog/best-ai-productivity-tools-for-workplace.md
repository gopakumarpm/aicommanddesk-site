## 2. Perplexity AI — The Smart Research Assistant

**Best for:** Research, competitive analysis, and finding information with sources.

Think of Perplexity as Google Search meets ChatGPT. You ask a question, and it searches the internet in real-time and gives you a clear, sourced answer instead of a list of links.

**What managers use it for:**
- Market research and competitor analysis
- Finding data points for presentations

## 6. Grammarly — The Writing Polisher

**Best for:** Making every email, document, and message more professional.
