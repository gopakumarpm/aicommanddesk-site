      <h2>Transparency First</h2>
      <p>At AICommandDesk, we believe in complete transparency with our readers. Some of the links on this website are affiliate links, which means we may earn a commission if you click on the link or make a purchase using the link.</p>

      <h2>What This Means for You</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No extra cost</strong> — You will never pay more because of an affiliate link. The price is the same whether you use our link or go directly to the vendor.</li>
        <li><strong>Honest recommendations</strong> — We only recommend products and services we have personally tested or genuinely believe will help our audience.</li>
        <li><strong>Editorial independence</strong> — Affiliate relationships never influence our editorial content. We will tell you if a tool is not worth it, even if we could earn a commission.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Affiliate Links Work</h2>
      <p>When you click an affiliate link on our site and make a purchase, the vendor pays us a small referral fee. This helps us keep the site running and continue creating free content for you.</p>

      <h2>Products We May Earn From</h2>
      <p>We may earn affiliate commissions from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>AI tools and software</li>
        <li>Productivity and SaaS products</li>
        <li>Online courses and educational platforms</li>
        <li>Hosting and web services</li>
        <li>Books and digital resources</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Promise</h2>
      <p>We will always prioritize your trust over any commission. If a product is bad, we will say so — even if we could earn money by recommending it. Your success is what builds our long-term success.</p>

      <h2>Questions?</h2>
